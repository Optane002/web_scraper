## Features & Resilience

- Modular architecture keeps core logic separate from site-specific scrapers.
- Initial coverage targets BuyAbans.com across major product categories.
- Automatic retries handle transient 504 errors with polite delays to avoid IP blocks.
- Brand extraction guards against messy or incomplete upstream JSON.
- Interactive CLI guides dependency checks, region selection, and scraper choice.
- Output exports to clean `.xlsx` files for analysis and sharing.

## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Install Python **3.8+**.

### 2. Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/Optane002/web_scraper.git
cd web_scraper
pip install -r requirements.txt  # requests, pandas, openpyxl, urllib3, etc.
```

### 3. Run the Scraper

```
python web_scraper.py
```

The CLI presents a shell-style header, performs dependency checks, then prompts for region and target site.

### Adding a New Website

1. **Create a scraper**: add `scrapers/<site>.py` with a function that accepts a config dict and returns a list of product dicts.
2. **Wire it up**:
   - Import your scraper inside `scrapers/__init__.py`.
   - Extend `SUPPORTED_SITES` in `config/sites.py` with the new entry (base URL, category IDs, export filename, etc.).
